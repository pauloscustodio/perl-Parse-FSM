1.00	2011-04-16

	Spin-off of the deterministic top-down parser based on a pre-computed
	finite state machine that was developped for the CPU::Z80::Assembler
	module. 

	New Features
	
	* parse a yacc-like BNF grammar and generate the parser module.
	  Note: the Parse::FSM::Parser module used to parse the BNF grammar 
	  is generated using the primitive add_rule from Parse::FSM.
	  
	* Lexer module based on Perl 5.10 regular expressions, to be subclassed.
	  The Parse::FSM::Lexer provides the primitives to allow recursive 
	  file includes and keeping track of current file and line number. A
	  subclass can override the tokenizer() method that matches the next 
	  token from a string.
